I've recognized the need for a refinement in my request.

I require the tracking of outputs from each function since each
subsequent function depends on the output of the preceding one.

For instance, if func3 produces an output of 10 in the initial run but
11 in the second run, it becomes necessary to rerun func4.

This is because func4 relies on the modified output of func3.

In Python, I aim to execute a sequence of functions to produce a final
result.

To optimize efficiency, I aim to avoid rerunning functions that have
successfully completed.

However, I need to re-execute some prior functions, even if they have
completed successfully, to test a function at the end of the chain.

To address this, I seek a pipeline mechanism that keeps track of
completed functions.

Subsequent runs of the pipeline should skip the execution of functions
that have already run successfully, ensuring they are not repeated
unnecessarily.
