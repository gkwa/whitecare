This works as expected very nice.

I realize I need to adjust my request.

I need to keep track of the outputs of each function because each
subsequent function relies on the otuput of the previous function.

For example, if the output of func3 is 10 on the first run but on the
second run, the output is 11, then we will want to re-run func4
because it relies on the output of func3 which has changed.

In Python, I aim to execute a sequence of functions to produce a final
result.

To optimize efficiency, I aim to avoid rerunning functions that have
successfully completed.

However, I need to re-execute some prior functions, even if they have
completed successfully, to test a function at the end of the chain.

To address this, I seek a pipeline mechanism that keeps track of
completed functions.

Subsequent runs of the pipeline should skip the execution of functions
that have already run successfully, ensuring they are not repeated
unnecessarily.
