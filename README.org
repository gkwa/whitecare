In Python, I aim to execute a sequence of functions to produce a final
result.

To optimize efficiency, I aim to avoid rerunning functions that have
successfully completed.

However, I need to re-execute some prior functions, even if they have
completed successfully, to test a function at the end of the chain.

To address this, I seek a pipeline mechanism that keeps track of
completed functions.

Subsequent runs of the pipeline should skip the execution of functions
that have already run successfully, ensuring they are not repeated
unnecessarily.
